# ESP32 WS2812b Clock
Experimenting with this incredible low-priced WS2812b 241-LED disk.

Dimensions of the disk are here: https://github.com/Mark-MDO47/ESP32WS2812bClock/blob/main/images/LED_241_Dimensions.jpg

With 241 LEDs, the RAM requirements exceed my old standby of Arduino Nano.  I chose the ESP32.
